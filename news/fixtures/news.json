            "description": "The FA, Premier League, EFL, FA Women's Super League, FA Women's Championship, PFA, LMA, PGMOL, Kick It Out, Women in Football and the FSA will unite for a social media boycott from 15:00 BST on Friday 30 April to 23:59 BST on Monday 3 May.",
            "content": "The FA, Premier League, EFL, FA Women's Super League, FA Women's Championship, PFA, LMA, PGMOL, Kick It Out, Women in Football and the FSA will unite for a social media boycott from 15:00 BST on Friday 30 April to 23:59 BST on Monday 3 May, in response to the ongoing and sustained discriminatory abuse received online by players and many others connected to football. This has been scheduled to take place across a full-fixture programme in the men's and women's professional game and will feature clubs across the Premier League, EFL, WSL and Women's Championship switching off their Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts. As a collective, the game recognises the considerable reach and value of social media to our sport. The connectivity and access to supporters who are at the heart of football remains vital. However, the boycott shows English football coming together to emphasise that social media companies must do more to eradicate online hate, while highlighting the importance of educating people in the ongoing fight against discrimination. In our letter of February 2021, English football outlined its requests of social media companies, urging filtering, blocking and swift takedowns of offensive posts, an improved verification process and re-registration prevention, plus active assistance for law enforcement agencies to identify and prosecute originators of illegal content. While some progress has been made, we reiterate those requests today in an effort to stem the relentless flow of discriminatory messages and ensure that there are real-life consequences for purveyors of online abuse across all platforms. Boycott action from football in isolation will, of course, not eradicate the scourge of online discriminatory abuse, but it will demonstrate that the game is willing to take voluntary and proactive steps in this continued fight.",

            "content": "Mohamed Salah (£12.6m) was the most-captained player in Fantasy Premier League for the 10th time this season but a goal may not have been enough to satisfy his backers. The Egyptian made the perfect start, scoring after just three minutes, but the 1.3million FPL managers who handed him the armband may well feel their captain missed out on a much bigger haul. Salah missed two big chances while also laying on a big chance for Sadio Mane (£11.7m), which also went begging. So far in 2020/21, a total of 35million Fantasy managers have handed Salah the armband. No player has been a more popular choice. The Leicester City duo of Jamie Vardy (£10.3m) and Kelechi Iheanacho (£6.2m) have replaced Kane in the estimation of the leading 100 FPL managers, with the Foxes hosting Crystal Palace on Monday. Since Gameweek 26, the pair have formed an effective partnership up front. No player has created more big chances than Vardy's five, while none has received more big chances than Iheanacho's eight. Vardy and Iheanacho were the two most-bought players ahead of the deadline, with Trent Alexander-Arnold (£7.5m) completing the top three. Iheanacho's ownership has rocketed over the last eight Gameweeks, during which he has eight goals. From an ownership of just 24,687, the Nigerian is now in over 1.7million teams. Alexander-Arnold had also been in excellent form, returning 40 points in his previous four matches. But his new backers were left disappointed after Newcastle United scored in stoppage time to limit the right-back to a two-point return. The three most-sold players this Gameweek are all without a fixture. The next Premier League match for Kane and Son Heung-min (£9.5m) is in Gameweek 34, while Manchester City's John Stones (£5.1m) is suspended until Gameweek 36.",

The clinic was set up to provide about 2,000 vaccinations to local people aged 45 or above.

A year ago, the indoor car park became a COVID-19 testing centre, while dressing rooms, medical and media facilities were transformed to host North Middlesex University Hospital’s Women’s Outpatient services. More than 41,500 appointments were delivered at the stadium up to July 2020. Spurs are just the latest Premier League club to offer their stadium to help vaccinations. Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Leeds United, Liverpool and Manchester City have allowed their facilities to become vaccination centres, while Brighton & Hove Albion and Manchester United's stadiums have hosted vaccination training.

Milner's 159th appearance as a substitute moved him one ahead of the record that had been held by Peter Crouch, who was quick to congratulate the new leader on Twitter. The record is perhaps under threat from Southampton striker Shane Long, who is 11 substitute appearances back but on loan at AFC Bournemouth at the moment. Long is one ahead of Jermain Defoe, who holds the record for the most goals off the bench, with 24. In joint-seventh in the ranking is Theo Walcott, who holds the record for having been substituted the most times. Walcott has been replaced 150 times during his spells at Arsenal, Everton and Southampton.",
